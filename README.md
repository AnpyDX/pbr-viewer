# PBRV

## introduce
**PBR Viewer** is a glTF model viewer written in C++ and OpenGL, which has following features:

- Physically Based Rendering
- Deferred Rendering
- Bloom
- Shadow (PCSS, SDFSS)
- Global Illumination (SSGI, SDFGI)

So basically this project is a graphics-tech toy and I do recommend you consider it as a study project only.
